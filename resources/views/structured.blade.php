            <p class="p-4">What is structured cabling? Structured cabling is the practice of installing cable in an organized and safe manner
                within a professional environment that has no negative impact on the productivity of the professional environment it is installed.
                Our technicians practice exceptional industry standards and safety practices and never cut corners during our installation process.
                Standards include most ANSI/TIA A-C class & 568-569 code standards and have the capability
                to install fiber and copper network backbones of any topology design. Our toplogists at NM Technology can
                design and implement custom proprietary networks that are isolated or integrated within the existing
                network or into a brand new facility. We also provide professional on-site maintenance for network support
                and more!<br></p>
